## Introduction

This is an example of a Steve Reich style phase piece.  The same sequence is played through two independent voices, but one is very slightly faster than the other.  The effect is that they move in and out of synchrony.

## Code 

{% include useqperform.html params="nosave&txt=/assets/code/phasepiece.useq" %}

## Audio
