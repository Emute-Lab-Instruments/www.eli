Myriad: a massive-sounding stereo eurorack multi-oscillator, with flexible modulation, powerful meta-modulation systems, and novel hybrid analogue/digital sounds synthesis.

Key Features:

- 12 oscillator models using Bitwave Synthesis
- 9 detunable oscillators (organised in 3 banks of 3, around 1700 combinations)
- Two types of output: clean, or shaped, using analog waveshaping and overdrive
- Stereo outputs for both clean and shaped sounds.
- Built-in VCA
- Adjustable CV control of pitch, spread, octave interval, VCA and epsilon (a parameter that controls something different in each oscillator model)
- 7 metamodulators - lively algorithmic modulation systems that influence the oscillator models
- Colour TFT screen
- Overdrive LEDs visible through the front panel
- Tuning and pitch quantisation
- Hackable open-source design - both hardware and software
