We are a project coming out of the [Experimental Music Technologies Lab](https://emutelab.org) at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/), UK.  We're taking music technology research from our group, and realising it in the form of hybrid digital/analogue musical instruments. Our first product, uSEQ, built on over a decade of research in livecoding.
