uSEQ is a eurorack module that brings livecoding into your modular system.  Fundamentally, it's an extremely  flexible voltage generator and processor.  It has a set of CV and pulse inputs and outputs, but instead of having a fixed set of controls and functions, you can choose how voltages are generated by *livecoding* them.  This means that you can control uSEQs behaviour with the vast possibilities of creative coding, using a simplified programming language specialised for music.  uSEQ is great for sequencing, waveform generation, and waveform processing. You can use it as a live performance tool, or configure it for specific functions.  

To use uSEQ, hook up a computer via the USB port, load up the editor in your browser and start playing.


Features:

- 2 CV inputs 
- 2 pulse inputs
- 3 CV outputs
- 3 pulse outputs
- a momentary switch
- a three-way toggle switch
- two attenuverter controls for the CV inputs
- LISP-based livecoding engine
- open source software and hardware
