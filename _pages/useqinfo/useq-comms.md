## Serial over USB

The easiest way to talk with the uSEQ module is with the online editor, but it's not the only way.  uSEQ opens up a serial-over-USB connection to any computer that you plug into it, so you can connect with any serial terminal app to send and receive text. You can connect to uSEQ with command line terminals, the terminal in the Arduino IDE, serial terminal apps on phones and tablets, Raspberry Pi's and other single board computers.  

## Identifying the connection

uSEQ will appear with different names on various operating systems. On unix-based systems, it will appear in the ```/dev/``` folder. On Windows, it will appear as a COM port.
