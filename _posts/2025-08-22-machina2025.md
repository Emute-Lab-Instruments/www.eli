[Machina Bristronica](https://machinabristronica.uk) is approaching fast!  ELI will be there for the weekend, launching our new module (watch this space!), and also Dimitris will be doing a talk 'Byte to Patch' on the Data Stage about livecoding in the eurorack ecosystem.

Also there's more Emute Lab research, with [Noise Peddlar](https://www.noisepeddler.com/) presenting too on the data stage.
