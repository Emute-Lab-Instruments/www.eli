uSEQ brings together code and cables, opening up modular synthesis to the vast possibilties of livecoding.  With a simplified coding engine, based on the LISP language, uSEQ can be used for sequencing, voltage processing, waveform and pattern generation, generative music, polyrhythms, long structured pieces, algorave performances and more. 

The module has pulse and CV inputs and outputs, pots and switches, all accessible via a small computer onboard. Connect to the module over USB using the in-browser editor, and send code that tells the module how to function.

uSEQ is released on 27th June 2024. It's available as a kit from [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/) and as a built module from Signal Sounds.
