Welcome to our new website (or in modulisp: ```(hello-world)```)  Emute Lab Instruments is a new project, based at the University of Sussex, and coming out of the [Experimental Music Technologies Lab](https://emutelabn.org) research group.  We're focused on making new instruments based on our music technology research.  Our first product is uSeq, a eurorack module, that brings two worlds together, livecoding and modular synthesis, in what we hope is a fun and performative approach to mixing digital and analogue musicking.  There's going to be quite a bit of activity on this site, as we get the modules ready to ship, and as the documentation materials come together.
