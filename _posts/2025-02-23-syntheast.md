Thanks to [Synth East](https://syntheast.com/) for organising a great event.  We were off to a great start on Friday night with B Movie and an inspiring interview with John Foxx. On Saturday, we demoed useq, and previewed our new multi-oscillator module Myriad.  We also showed a unit from the MEML project that does some playful sequencing with machine learning.
